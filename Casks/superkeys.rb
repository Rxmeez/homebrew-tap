  caveats <<~EOS
    Superkeys is not notarised by Apple, so macOS blocks it the first time
    you open it. Click Done (not Move to Bin), then allow it once:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway
    Then grant Accessibility when Superkeys asks. Step by step:
      https://superkeys.space/install
    Updates install themselves after that, with no more prompts.
